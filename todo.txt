todo: Calling the ajaxLeftovers plugin should trigger the request, and not bind it. Thus leaving the dev to choose the binding method.
todo: When calling the ajaxLeftovers plugin you should be able to set the values that can be provided by the metas
todo: Default binding should be on window.load
todo: In addition to event triggered on click, provide examples with event binded to window.load
todo: Sample connector.json should be expanded, human readable
todo: Add support for JSONP through the plugin options
todo: Iterate through "data" with .each instead of "for (var i in data)"... otherwise, text item membership to its parent (see jslint error)
todo: Support multiple "leftovers-connector" instructions
todo: Support automatic binding for "leftovers-connector" instructions (removes the need to trigger the plugin)
todo: Support for the "prepend" method
todo: Options for a "fade-in" for new content
todo: Instead of using eval, create a "script" tag and append it. This will queue the execution outside of the plugin's scope and prevent any exception to interupt its task.
todo: Refactor: $(data[i].selector) and data[i] is called too often, cache the value
todo: Provide a way for the server to ask the script to "repeat this request in XX seconds"
